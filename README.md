# Social-Distanced-Seating-Reinforcement-Learning

This study is an extension of the Tokyo Olympic VRP Seating Computation. A deep reinforcement learning script is created to maximize the seating efficiency. It treats the task of putting seats as a game and repeats the game for an average of 2,000 times while learning from every move it made. 

It generally beats a recursive "crawler" script with a set of pre-defined rules by 10-20% of seating efficiency.
